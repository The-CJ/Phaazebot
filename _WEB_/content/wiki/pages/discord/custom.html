        The Normal commands are not enough?

        Make your own!

        You can add up to <b>150</b> Custom commands, without trigger limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Want a bot that greets everyone saying "Hi" or "Hey" or whatever, just make it. There are no Syntax rules. <br>
        <i>(NOTE: "@everyone" as a trigger is not forbidden, but stupid)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        It also supports command Token e.g.: [uses] - will be replaced with the number of times the command was triggered.

      <p>
        Moderator or higher can create or delete commands with <code><a href="/wiki?page=discord/mod/addcom">>>addcom</a></code>
        and <code><a href="/wiki?page=mod/delcom">>>delcom</a></code>,<br>
        after you set some, everyone can use <code><a href="/wiki?page=commands/custom">>custom</a></code> to check what commands are available.<br>
        Commands can also be viewed in web on <code>phaaze.net/discord/custom/&lt;serverID&gt;</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Moderator and higher can also visit the dashboard at <code>phaaze.net/discord/dashboard/&lt;serverID&gt;#custom</code><br>
        and can manage commands from there.
      </p>
      <p>
        All custom commands can be used in all channels, <br>
        but moderators or higher can disable the use per channel with <code><a href="/wiki?page=mod/settings#custom">>>settings custom</a></code>
